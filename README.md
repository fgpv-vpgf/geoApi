This is a library that is utilized by the [Reusable Accessible Mapping Platform (RAMP2)](https://github.com/fgpv-vpgf/fgpv-vpgf). It primarily houses and abstracts the bulk of the geospatial related functionality. Please visit the RAMP2 repo for documentation, samples, and the main platform application.
